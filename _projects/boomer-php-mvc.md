# Motivation
<br>
Boomer PHP MVC is an Framework made by me to learn PHP and core web development and software engineering concepts like Object Oriented programming, Model-View-Controller architecture, AJAX programming etc

Without the aid of a pre-existing framework like Laravel, or any external packages

A demo app, made using this framework, also called BOOMER is built with the classic Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP stack inside Docker containers on an Ubuntu host

Boomer PHP MVC implements most common sense Web Framework features from scratch, like a Router, Middlewares, Input Validation, SQL Query Builder and Sessions based Authentication.
