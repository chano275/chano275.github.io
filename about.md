I am Shawn Dâ€™silva, a Full Stack Web Developer, Designer and Embedded Systems enthusiast.
<br>
<br>
The purpose of this section of my website is to document my projects and other blog posts related to Full Stack Web Development, Embedded Linux, Operating Systems, hobby Electronics and Microcontroller Firmware programming.
<br>
<br>
I am fascinated about the low-level, inner workings of processors and modern electronics in general that are abstracted away from the average user, both hardware and firmware, and love reading material related to Computer Architecture, Digital Electronics and Embedded Systems.
<br>
<br>
I believe that good code should have clear and concise Documentation and comments, and
therefore endeavor to use my Blog and Githubto share anything new that i have learnt, or
document my projects
